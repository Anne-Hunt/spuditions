## DESCRIPTION

Spuditions is a team application to allow users to see the current a near future conditions and information about Idaho's state and national parks systems. Weather is included for the next five days and each park has its own page with a list of activities and links to the appropriate state or federal agency page. Users can join the forums and have conversations about related topics, either creating threads or commenting in response to other user's threads. Users can also search content, including profiles, forum content, and the parks themselves. The authorization is made by the team and uses Argon2 instead of Auth0, used in most related work.
